This repository contains Java implementations of distributed algorithms using the JADE framework for a university master's level distributed algorithms course.

It includes solutions for six practical works focused on different fundamental distributed algorithms concepts.

Each practical work contains JADE agent code implementing the core distributed algorithm logic. All solutions utilize message passing between agents to coordinate 
and synchronize the algorithm across the distributed system.
